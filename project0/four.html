    <h1>Can the Virus Spread from Mother to Child in Pregnancy?</h1>
    <p>
        Medical experts haven’t determined whether a woman can transmit SARS-CoV-2 in utero, through childbirth, or through her breast milk.The CDC currently recommendsTrusted Source that mothers with a confirmed case of the virus, as well as those who may have
        it, are temporarily separated from their newborns. This separation helps decrease the risk of transmission. Women should speak with their healthcare providers about the benefits and risks of breastfeeding. The CDC hasn’t released any official
        guidelines regarding whether women with confirmed or suspected cases should avoid breastfeeding. They have, however, suggested that these women take the following precautionary measuresTrusted Source:
        <ul>
            <li>Wear a face mask while breastfeeding, if possible.</li>
            <li>Properly wash their hands before holding or breastfeeding their infant.</li>
            <li>Properly wash their hands before touching a bottle or breast pump.</li>
            <li>Clean the breast pump each time it’s used.</li>
        </ul>
