    <h1>Pick it up from Infected Surfaces</h1>
    <p>
        Think of all the frequently touched surfaces where germs can lurk: kitchen counters, bathroom counters, doorknobs, elevator buttons, the handle on the refrigerator, handrails on staircases. The list goes on and on. Experts don’t know for sure how long
        the novel coronavirus can survive on these surfaces. But if the virus behaves like other, similar viruses, the survival time could range from several hours to several daysTrusted Source. The type of surface, the temperature of the room, and the
        humidity in the environment may play a role in how long the virus can survive on a surface. But since we don’t know for sure, if you think a surface may be contaminated, clean it thoroughly with a disinfectant. A diluted bleach solution or an
        EPA-approved disinfectant is likely the most effectiveTrusted Source cleaner for this purpose. And if someone in your home is sick, frequently clean those surfaces. Remember to thoroughly wash your hands afterward.
