    <h1>Methods To Avoid Corona Virus</h1>

    <p>
        Like many others, you probably have questions about the 2019 coronavirus. And one of those questions may have to do with how the virus is able to spread.

        <h2>
            Brief Explanation On Corona Virus!
        </h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            First, some brief explanation about the coronavirus itself: The clinical name for this novel coronavirus is actually SARS-CoV-2. It stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. It originated from a family of other virusesTrusted Source
            that cause respiratory diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Because the novel coronavirus is a new strain, it’s unfamiliar to our immune systems. And there’s not yet a vaccine
            for it.
