    <h1>Methods To Avoid Corona Virus</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Like many others, you probably have questions about the 2019 coronavirus. And one of those questions may have to do with how the virus is able to spread.

        <h2>
            Brief Explanation On Corona Virus!
        </h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            First, some brief explanation about the coronavirus itself: The clinical name for this novel coronavirus is actually SARS-CoV-2. It stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. It originated from a family of other virusesTrusted Source
            that cause respiratory diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Because the novel coronavirus is a new strain, it’s unfamiliar to our immune systems. And there’s not yet a vaccine
            for it.

        <p>
            Person-to-person contact is thought to be the main method of transmission for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source. Imagine sitting next to someone with a SARS-CoV-2 infection on the bus
            or in a meeting room. Suddenly, this person sneezes or coughs. If they don’t cover their mouth and nose, they could potentially spray you with respiratory droplets from their nose or mouth. The droplets that land on you will likely contain
            the virus. Or perhaps you meet someone who contracted the virus, and they touched their mouth or nose with their hand. When that person shakes your hand, they transfer some of the virus to your hand. If you then touch your mouth or nose without
            washing your hands first, you may accidentally give that virus an entry point into your own body. One recent small studyTrusted Source suggested that the virus may also be present in feces and could contaminate places like toilet bowls and
            bathroom sinks. But the researchers noted the possibility of this being a mode of transmission needs more research.
        </p>
        <h3 id="i-s">
            Pick it up from Infected Surfaces
        </h3>
        <p>
            Think of all the frequently touched surfaces where germs can lurk: kitchen counters, bathroom counters, doorknobs, elevator buttons, the handle on the refrigerator, handrails on staircases. The list goes on and on. Experts don’t know for sure how long
            the novel coronavirus can survive on these surfaces. But if the virus behaves like other, similar viruses, the survival time could range from several hours to several daysTrusted Source. The type of surface, the temperature of the room, and
            the humidity in the environment may play a role in how long the virus can survive on a surface. But since we don’t know for sure, if you think a surface may be contaminated, clean it thoroughly with a disinfectant. A diluted bleach solution
            or an EPA-approved disinfectant is likely the most effectiveTrusted Source cleaner for this purpose. And if someone in your home is sick, frequently clean those surfaces. Remember to thoroughly wash your hands afterward.
        </p>
        <h3 id="n-s">
            Spread the virus even if they don’t have Symptoms
        </h3>
        <p>
            Right now, the World Health Organization (WHO)Trusted Source suggests that your risk for contracting the novel coronavirus from someone who isn’t showing any symptoms is very low. But here’s some sobering news: Experts do believe it’s possible that someone
            with a novel coronavirus infection could transmit it to othersTrusted Source even if they don’t show any symptoms, or have such mild symptoms that they don’t really know they’re sick. According to the CDCTrusted Source, a person who has contracted
            the virus is most contagious when they’re showing symptoms — and that’s when they’re the most likely to transmit the virus. But someone may be able to pass on the virus even before they start to show symptoms of the disease itself. The symptoms
            may take anywhere from 2 to 14 days to show up after exposure to the virus. One recent studyTrusted Source of 181 patients with COVID-19 found a median incubation period of about 5 days, with more than 97 percent showing symptoms by 11.5 days
            after exposure to the virus.

            Can the Virus Spread from Mother to Child in Pregnancy?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Medical experts haven’t determined whether a woman can transmit SARS-CoV-2 in utero, through childbirth, or through her breast milk.The CDC currently recommendsTrusted Source that mothers with a confirmed case of the virus, as well as those who may have
            it, are temporarily separated from their newborns. This separation helps decrease the risk of transmission. Women should speak with their healthcare providers about the benefits and risks of breastfeeding. The CDC hasn’t released any official
            guidelines regarding whether women with confirmed or suspected cases should avoid breastfeeding. They have, however, suggested that these women take the following precautionary measuresTrusted Source:
            <ul>
                <li>Wear a face mask while breastfeeding, if possible.</li>
                <li>Properly wash their hands before holding or breastfeeding their infant.</li>
                <li>Properly wash their hands before touching a bottle or breast pump.</li>
                <li>Clean the breast pump each time it’s used.</li>
