        Person-to-person contact is thought to be the main method of transmission for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source. Imagine sitting next to someone with a SARS-CoV-2 infection on the bus
        or in a meeting room. Suddenly, this person sneezes or coughs. If they donâ€™t cover their mouth and nose, they could potentially spray you with respiratory droplets from their nose or mouth. The droplets that land on you will likely contain the
        virus. Or perhaps you meet someone who contracted the virus, and they touched their mouth or nose with their hand. When that person shakes your hand, they transfer some of the virus to your hand. If you then touch your mouth or nose without washing
        your hands first, you may accidentally give that virus an entry point into your own body. One recent small studyTrusted Source suggested that the virus may also be present in feces and could contaminate places like toilet bowls and bathroom sinks.
        But the researchers noted the possibility of this being a mode of transmission needs more research.
