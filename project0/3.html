    <h1>Spread the virus even if they don’t have Symptoms</h1>
    <p>
        Right now, the World Health Organization (WHO)Trusted Source suggests that your risk for contracting the novel coronavirus from someone who isn’t showing any symptoms is very low. But here’s some sobering news: Experts do believe it’s possible that someone
        with a novel coronavirus infection could transmit it to othersTrusted Source even if they don’t show any symptoms, or have such mild symptoms that they don’t really know they’re sick. According to the CDCTrusted Source, a person who has contracted
        the virus is most contagious when they’re showing symptoms — and that’s when they’re the most likely to transmit the virus. But someone may be able to pass on the virus even before they start to show symptoms of the disease itself. The symptoms
        may take anywhere from 2 to 14 days to show up after exposure to the virus. One recent studyTrusted Source of 181 patients with COVID-19 found a median incubation period of about 5 days, with more than 97 percent showing symptoms by 11.5 days
        after exposure to the virus.
